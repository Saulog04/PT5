  <h1>Christmas Letter</h1>
  <div class="letter">
    <h3>Dear Mom,<br><br>
      This Christmas, I want to take a moment to express just how much you mean to me and how deeply I appreciate everything you’ve done for me. There are so many things I want to say, but words will never be enough to capture the depth of my love and gratitude for you.<br><br>
      
      From the very beginning, you’ve been my greatest supporter, my teacher, and my best friend. Your unwavering love and sacrifices have shaped who I am today. You’ve always been there, through every joy, challenge, and triumph, and I know I am so lucky to have a mother as incredible as you.<br><br>

      Your strength inspires me every single day. Whether it’s the way you face challenges with grace, the way you give endlessly to those around you, or the way you light up a room with your kindness and warmth—everything about you fills my heart with admiration.<br><br>

      I often think about the little things you do that make life so much better—your comforting words when I’m feeling low, your laugh that brightens my days, and the way you always seem to know exactly what I need. These moments may seem small, but they mean everything to me. Thank you for being the heart of our family and the anchor in my life.<br><br>

      This Christmas, I want to celebrate you and all the love and joy you bring into our lives. I hope you know how much you are cherished, not just today but every single day. You are the most selfless and loving person I know, and I aspire to be even half as amazing as you.<br><br>

      Mom, you are my rock and my greatest blessing. I hope this Christmas season brings you the happiness and peace you so greatly deserve. You’ve spent your life taking care of others, and I hope you take this time to feel all the love and gratitude we have for you.<br><br>

      Merry Christmas, Mom! I love you more than words can ever express, and I am so grateful to have you as my mother.<br><br>

      With all my love,<br>
      Andrei
